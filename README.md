# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
This project implements a *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* model to predict *diabetes* based on key medical parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset contains diagnostic features such as *glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, insulin levels, and age* to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Model & Approach
- *Preprocessing*: Handled missing values, normalized features, and split data into training and test sets.
- *Algorithm*: Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an optimized kernel.
- *Evaluation*: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

## Installation & Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
